Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

**I am working on Windows or MacOs. Can I use iBridges?**
----------------------
Yes, iBridges was developed for all three major operating systems, Windows, MacOs and Linux. We test all of our components on all three operating systems.

**When should I use iBridges instead of python-irodsclient or icommands?**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The python-irodsclient and the iCommands are much more powerful and expressive than iBridges. Both offer full access to all features of an iRODS server. 

If you are already
intimately familiar with either of them, you probably don't need iBridges, since it doesn't add any functionality that isn't
already there.

The target audience of iBridges is different: it tries to help **researchers and scientific programmers** who are not familiar with the features of iRODS nor the setup of the server to execute basic and simple data tasks. 

The learning curve of using iBridges is much less steep than the learning curves of either of the two mentioned alternatives.
Additionally, its simplicity and default checks make it less likely you will end up with corrupted or imcompletely transferred data.

An advantage compared to the iCommands is that iBridges also works on Mac OS and Windows.


**I want to contribute to iBridges, where do I go?**

Our development is done on `GitHub <https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/iBridges>`__ We are welcoming contributions
by pull requests. You can also ask for new features/ideas in our issue tracker.

**How can I get started?**
---------------
We provide a quickstart tutorial and in-depth tutorials which also explain hwo iRODS helps in Research Data Management.

**How do I have to setup my laptop to connect to my iRODS/Yoda server**
----------------------------------
Setting up an iRODS client can be difficult. 
We provide a tutorial, which configuration file is expected where on your laptop and how the configuration should look like:
